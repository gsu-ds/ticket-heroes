# Fundamentals of Data Science Project (Fall 2025)

## Abstract 

Concert ticket prices fluctuate in an unexpected manner before the actual event. Instead of overpaying for bad tickets for the rest of our lives, we aim to build a data-driven recommendation system that predicts the optimal day to buy a ticket for a specific concert or artist, using time series forecasting and machine learning regression within a serverless (AWS Lambda) pipeline.


## 🧑‍🚀 Team

We are an student research team searching for the perfect time to buy concert tickets.

## Goals

- To design a model that intakes real-time data and outputs a recommendation on if you ahould buy that ticket now or at a later date.

## Infrastructure & Tech Stack
- tbd
  
##  Development Environment

This project uses [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to ensure a consistent, reproducible development setup.

--- 

### Quick Start

1. **Open in Codespaces**  
   Click the green **Code** button on this repository, then choose **Open with Codespaces** → **New codespace**.

2. **Automatic setup**  
   The dev container will automatically install Python and all required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. **Activate the environment**  
   When your Codespace starts, you’re ready to run scripts and notebooks immediately.
   - If (dscvenv) does not show in terminal, follow these steps:
      - Activate virtual env: (bash)-> source dscvenv/bin/activate or powershell-> ( dscvenv\Activate\scripts)
      - Use requirements.txt to ensure installations: pip install -r requirements.txt
