Data Collection:

Ticketmaster discovery api -> worked
spotify api -> works, needs finetuning
openmeteo api -> works
predicthq -> free trial, allows me to pull 90 days in the past <-present-> 90 days into the future concert/sports/festival Data

attempting to webscrape tourdatesearch.com and concertarchives.org



after dataset is built up and aggregated, we need to clean and combine the datasets to create data panels, then build the models,
modeling will be same strategy as capstone project, regressors + poisson + rolling cv on wandb tests
